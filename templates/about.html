                    <h2   class="heading_top col-xs-12" style="border: none">WHY IT STARTED?</h2>
                    <p class="about"> We all love our looks and want to be in our best selves. But we often struggle to get what<br>
                        we deserve or what we are looking for. With so much options out there but with so little <br>
                        assistance available, all of us need to have a know it all guide.<br><br>

                        We took this as a challenge and started working on this to change the complexion<br>
                        of the game. Backed up with a young, energetic and vibrant team, ideas kept evolving and we took the shape of LookPlex. Yes, looks is what we deal in.<br>

                    <h2   class="heading_top col-xs-12" style="border: none">WHEN IT STARTED?</h2>
                    <p class="about"> Like most of the big things, it started with an idea. An idea to organize the largely <br>
                        unstructured beauty, wellness and fitness sector and this happened in the winters of <br>
                        2015. Things started falling in place soon after and team LookPlex expanded with some<br> great people driven by the same idea. <br><br>
                        Idea followed by surveys, market studies, analysis, suggestions, feedback and team building. This took the shape of an organization in the springs of 2015. <br>Since then, we have been moving on to reach maximum people in the most efficient way and in minimum span of time.
